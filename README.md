# Kanban Board App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br />
Tech used: **React** for UI, **Redux** for global state management, **Styled Components** for styling, **Typescript** for type safety, **Prettier** for code formatting.

## Live Demo

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
